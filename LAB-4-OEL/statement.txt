EXPERIMENT 4

VOTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Open Ended Lab)

Objective:
To be able to construct solution for the given open-ended problem.

Problem Statement:
You want to produce a program to store data about eligible voters in Pakistan.
The system should be able to execute:
1. Add a new voter to the system efficiently.
2. Remove a voter if he/she passes away or becomes ineligible.
3. Print the list of all currently eligible voters.
4. Search for a voter by CNIC.
5. Print the voter with maximum count (as the winner).

You should store enough data and investigate the performance of your system versus if used
any other data structure as compared to the one you chose for writing your program.

Deliverables:
Write a report that provides a brief description of your designed system and includes the following
sections:
1. Design
2. Implementation in C++
3. Output
4. Performance Analysis
